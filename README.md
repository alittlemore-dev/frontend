# alittlemore.dev Frontend

Shared Angular frontend repository for alittlemore.dev. It currently contains the migrated
Competency Trainer hybrid SSR/CSR application unchanged and is the root build context for the
single frontend image. Public article pages, the public site-build case study, the public updates
page, and public competency matrix question pages are server-rendered for SEO, while protected
admin content/team workspaces and interactive areas stay hydrated Angular.

In the full application stack, infrastructure nginx remains the public edge proxy:

- `/` is proxied to the frontend Node.js SSR container.
- `/api/*` is proxied to the backend service.
- `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` are proxied to backend-generated discovery endpoints.
- TLS, public domains, MinIO, and backup UI routing stay in the infrastructure layer.

## Development server

Use Node.js 24.16.0 for local frontend commands (`.nvmrc` matches CI). The production Docker
image uses its own pinned Node.js runtime documented below.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

Frontend Make targets prepare npm dependencies automatically when `node_modules` is missing or stale.

```bash
make build
```

The production build is written to `dist/competency-trainer-frontend/browser`.

SSR output is written to `dist/competency-trainer-frontend/server`. To build and run the public SEO HTML smoke check for public article pages, the site-build case study, the updates page, and matrix question pages, run:

```bash
make ssr-smoke
```

To build the production SSR bundle and run strict Lighthouse CI quality and performance gates for
the public SSR/CSR route sample, run:

```bash
make lighthouse
```

Reports are written to `performance/reports/lighthouse/`.

## Docker image

Build the frontend image from this directory:

```bash
docker build -t "frontend:${IMAGE_TAG:?set IMAGE_TAG}" .
```

The image uses:

- `node:26.7.0-alpine` to install dependencies and run the Angular production build.
- `node:26.7.0-alpine` as the production runtime for `dist/competency-trainer-frontend/server/server.mjs`.
- Production dependencies are installed in the runtime stage, then npm/npx and the npm cache are removed from the final image because the server runtime only needs `node`.
- Explicit runtime environment: `PORT`, `SSR_API_ORIGIN`, `APP_URL_SCHEMA`, `APP_DOMAIN`, and optionally `SSR_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` / `NG_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

Canonical SEO routes served by the frontend SSR runtime include `/ru/competency/articles/:slug`, `/en/competency/articles/:slug`, `/ru/how-this-site-is-built`, `/en/how-this-site-is-built`, `/ru/updates`, `/en/updates`, `/ru/competency/matrix/questions/:slug`, and `/en/competency/matrix/questions/:slug`. The matrix overview routes remain hydrated Angular pages. Legacy localized article and matrix routes temporarily redirect to the corresponding `/competency/...` paths.

## Repository boundary

Frontend-owned files live directly at this repository root, including Angular source code, public
assets, the frontend Dockerfile, and the Angular SSR runtime entrypoint. Do not introduce another
top-level `frontend/` directory.

The frontend should not own TLS, public domain routing, backend proxy rules, sitemap/robots routing, MinIO routing, or backup service routing. Those belong to the infrastructure repository.

## Running unit tests

```bash
make test
```

## Linting

```bash
make lint
```
